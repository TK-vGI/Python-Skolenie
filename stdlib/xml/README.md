# XML processing

1. **ElementTree**: This is a lightweight and efficient API for parsing and creating  
XML data. It provides methods to iterate over elements in the XML tree.  

2. **minidom**: minidom is a minimal implementation of the Document Object Model  
interface, with an API similar to that in other languages. It is intended for  
simple, one-time tasks.  

3. **SAX (Simple API for XML)**: SAX is a standard interface for event-driven XML  
parsing. It provides a mechanism to read data from an XML document.  

4. **DOM (Document Object Model)**: DOM is a standard tree structure, where each  
node contains one of the components from an XML structure.  

5. **xmltodict**: xmltodict is a Python module that makes working with XML feel  
like you are working with JSON. It converts XML to an OrderedDict.  

6. **BeautifulSoup**: BeautifulSoup is a Python library used for web scraping  
purposes to pull the data out of HTML and XML files. It creates a parse tree  
from page source code that can be used to extract data in a hierarchical and  
readable manner.  


## xml.etree.ElementTree (ElementTree)

* A lightweight and user-friendly API for parsing and manipulating XML data.  
* Represents the XML document as a tree structure, with elements as nodes.  
* Ideal for smaller to medium-sized XML files.  

```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

tree = ET.parse("products.xml")
root = tree.getroot()

for product in root.findall("product"):
  id = product.find("id").text
  name = product.find("name").text
  print(f"ID: {id}, Name: {name}")
```


## xml.dom.minidom (minidom)

A W3C DOM (Document Object Model) compliant parser. Provides a more comprehensive API for  
accessing and modifying XML elements and attributes. Offers functionalities like navigating  
the document tree, adding/removing nodes, and modifying attributes. 

Might be slower than `ElementTree` for large datasets.

Example:

```python
from xml.dom import minidom

doc = minidom.parse("products.xml")
root = doc.documentElement

for product in root.getElementsByTagName("product"):
  id = product.getElementsByTagName("id")[0].firstChild.nodeValue
  name = product.getElementsByTagName("name")[0].firstChild.nodeValue
  print(f"ID: {id}, Name: {name}")
```


## xml.sax (SAX - Simple API for XML)

An event-based parser that processes XML data as a stream of events  
(start/end tags, character data). More memory-efficient for very large XML files as it  
doesn't need to load the entire document in memory at once. Requires writing custom  
event handlers to handle different parsing events.  

```python
from xml.sax import make_parser, ContentHandler

class ProductHandler(ContentHandler):
  def __init__(self):
    self.current_data = ""
    self.product = {}
  
  def startElement(self, name, attrs):
    self.current_data = ""
    if name == "product":
      self.product = {}
  
  def characters(self, content):
    self.current_data += content.strip()
  
  def endElement(self, name):
    if name != "product":
      self.product[name] = self.current_data
    else:
      print(f"ID: {self.product['id']}, Name: {self.product['name']}")

parser = make_parser()
parser.setContentHandler(ProductHandler())
parser.parse("products.xml")
```

## Third-party libraries

Several powerful third-party libraries like lxml and Beautiful Soup offer extended  
functionalities for complex XML processing including:

- Support for various XML namespaces.  
- Advanced XPath and CSS selector support for element selection.  
- Validation against XML schemas.  

These libraries typically build upon the standard libraries mentioned above and  
provide a more feature-rich experience.

Choosing the right parser depends on the size and complexity of your XML data,  
performance requirements, and desired level of control over the parsing process.
