```python
# transform to lowercase using list comprehension
words = ["skY", "NEW", "Output", "blue", "SMart", 'oceaN']

# filter even vals using list comprehension
vals = [3, 4, 2, 1, 9, 11, 10, 8, 7, 6, 3]

# calculate sum
data = "1;2;3;4;5;6,7;8;9;10"

# filter out words with length 3 and ending in 't'
words2 = ["sky", "war", "put", "out", "ocean", 'os', 'season', 'arch']

# read words.txt into a list and sort it
```
