## Notebook

The notebook have the `.ipynb` extension.  The `Ctrl+Enter` runs the current cell, the `Shift+Enter` runs  
the current cell and advances to the next. The `Alt+Enter` runs the currently selected cell and inserts a  
new cell immediately below (focus remains on current cell).  


There are two modes: *edit mode* & *command mode*. The `Enter` key starts the edit mode and the `Esc` key  
the command mode.  

In command mode, the `A` adds a cell above, the `B` adds a cell below the selected cell, the `dd` deletes the cell.  
The `M` switches the cell type to markdown and the `Y` switches the cell type to code. 

The `Alt+Arrow` moves one or more cells.
