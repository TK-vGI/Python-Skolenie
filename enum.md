# Enum type


An *enumeration* is a set of symbolic names bound to unique, constant values. Enumerations  
can be used to create simple custom data types which include things such as seasons, weeks,  
types of weapons in a game, planets, grades, or days. By convention, enumeration names begin  
with an uppercase letter and are singular.  

The enum module is used for creating enumerations in Python. Enumerations are created with the  
class keyword or with the functional API.  

Enumeration is a data type introduced in Python 3.4.
